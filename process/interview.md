## Relate to time
### Martina (38)
When I think about time, I think about the count, its like a way how we put things in order
I think it's like a relative 

### Anastasia (46)
For me, time is a means of measuring and determining some points of being from the point of view of the past, the future and the present. I can measure time only with night, if i don't have clock or phone 

### Silas (4)

Time for me it's 100 hours

### Nastia (18)

Time for me is a resource, a kind of currency.
You spend time gaining knowledge and experience from the general history and when communicating with people. Soon this knowledge can be applied in some life businesses. But time is also a limitation, starting from small - to be on time for work, go to bed on time, etc. And ending with such restrictions as old age and death

### Alina (20)

Well, time is a resource and something frightening, objectively

### Stanislav (54)

As a gift from the Higher powers
It gives experience that turns into life wisdom, with the recollection of past emotions and feelings.

### Katerina(14)

For me it doesn't exist

### Huan(19)

What is time for me?*

Time is a measurable physical magnitude, that is relative (yes, Einstein), but can't be stopped. 

Why relative? For example, Time passes differently when gravity is different, as the already mentioned Theory says.

As I understand, If you could theoretically have a place where gravity is infinite, time would stop (but it is impossible, you *cannot* do it). 

It's just so hard to define or tell, but If you have watched Interstellar you understand (about gravity/time relation). Even if is strange to give an example from a sci-fi movie.

But also I mean that in another way. Subjectively. One can feel the passing of time, even if it is just a sensation, in a different way than other people. For me, this day could feel passing so fast, but for some people, it's the slowest/longer day they have ever had.

How do I feel about time?*

Well, I'll tell you how I feel about the time that I've lived in the past, and the time I have for living, which also includes how I feel about death because it's attached.

It feels like, the time it's never going to be enough to do all I want. I'm a little bit scared of not having enough time, dying too soon, or doing things too late. I don't wanna be a frustrated grandpa. But is also amazing that it never stops, making life spicy, and fast-paced. The important thing is to manage time well, even If we haven't a bigger purpose.

### Maude (20)

Time is a perception that helps us find our bearings and interact with other people.  It's a bit of a mysterious concept that seems to change depending on our state of mind (it's relative).  Often it serves to remind us that nothing is forever and it can bring both fear and relief.
I feel a little disoriented about time, I know my time on earth is limited but I don't know yet how I'm going to use it.  I feel like I have time to do a lot of things but at the same time I feel like I won't be able to do everything.  It's confusing.

## Alexandra (46)

Time is the most valuable thing for me, and time is money for me also. I am very sensitive to time and how it goes. And depending on the situation, when you want things to happen faster, time flies  slower, and on the opposite, when you want things to happen slower, time flies faster

## Julia (55)

For me, time is infinity, but without a return, those are irreversible

## Saul (19)

Well, for me time is the measurement of the succession events, one after another. And it feels different depending on what you are doing. It's going fast or slow. As the Theory of relativity says. I also have heard that it's also called the 4th dimension.
It has the characteristic of being completely continuous and unstoppable, somehow swallowing everything in its path. It can be terrifying to know that in a certain way nothing is really certain of being, since time is destroying and creating lots of scenarios every second, scenarios and situations that will never be repeated in exactly the same way, gradually approaching the end of all. However, we can see our daily life having only the present without staying in the past or anticipating the future, but living each moment fully attending to the context of that moment. However, we can see our life only paying attention to the present, not staying in the past, or thinking of the future but plenty living each moment, according to the context of that specific moment

## Peregrin (38)

Everything in this world is relative.  For example, the length of a minute depends on which side of the toilet door you are on.

## Vitalik (36)

Time is movement.

## Nastia (26)

Time for me is something very important in understanding
This is the ONLY thing that everyone can control in their life, it does not depend on the circumstances, etc., even if you are in prison, for example, you can read
But this is something that, unfortunately, no one usually controls properly

## Misha (25)

Time is a train in which living organisms jump and jump

## Tania (35)

The question "What is time for you?"
And my answer to this, as in the majority, is based precisely on the life of a person, so it is not about selfishness, and even more so not with a minus sign), but the reproduction of one's own experience as a person.
In addition, time cannot be felt by those classic 6 senses for creatures (taste, touch, hearing, and even sight). This is pure philosophy, and philosophy is a purely human property)

## Karina (23)

Time for me is still a lush green tree from which one leaf at a time is slowly falling
The leaves represent lost opportunities and the passage of years, life, etc


## Olga (14)

Time is money

## Anna (14)

Time is hours

## Ric(63)

Time for me have a physical side - when it goes from the past to the future clear directly. From the other side, it's doesn't have a clear direction, from example 1 min and 1 day can feel different, depending on how and with whom you spent this time

## Svetlana (78)

Time is fleeting when we are happy and have achieved what we want. And stretches slowly when we feel bad. But life gives us time to go through everything and it's wonderful

### Kirill(19)

Time for me is "the boundaries of life"
