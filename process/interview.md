## Relate to time
### Martina (38)
When I think about time, I think about the count, its like a way how we put things in order
I think it's like a relative 

### Anastasia (46)
For me, time is a means of measuring and determining some points of being from the point of view of the past, the future and the present. I can measure time only with night, if i don't have clock or phone 

### Silas (4)

Time for me it's 100 hours

### Nastia (18)

Time for me is a resource, a kind of currency.
You spend time gaining knowledge and experience from the general history and when communicating with people. Soon this knowledge can be applied in some life businesses. But time is also a limitation, starting from small - to be on time for work, go to bed on time, etc. And ending with such restrictions as old age and death

### Alina (20)

Well, time is a resource and something frightening, objectively

### Stanislav (54)

As a gift from the Higher powers
It gives experience that turns into life wisdom, with the recollection of past emotions and feelings.

### Kirill(19) and Katerina(14)

For me it doesn't exist

### Huan(19)

What is time for me?*

Time is a measurable physical magnitude, that is relative (yes, Einstein), but can't be stopped. 

Why relative? For example, Time passes differently when gravity is different, as the already mentioned Theory says.

As I understand, If you could theoretically have a place where gravity is infinite, time would stop (but it is impossible, you *cannot* do it). 

It's just so hard to define or tell, but If you have watched Interstellar you understand (about gravity/time relation). Even if is strange to give an example from a sci-fi movie.

But also I mean that in another way. Subjectively. One can feel the passing of time, even if it is just a sensation, in a different way than other people. For me, this day could feel passing so fast, but for some people, it's the slowest/longer day they have ever had.

How do I feel about time?*

Well, I'll tell you how I feel about the time that I've lived in the past, and the time I have for living, which also includes how I feel about death because it's attached.

It feels like, the time it's never going to be enough to do all I want. I'm a little bit scared of not having enough time, dying too soon, or doing things too late. I don't wanna be a frustrated grandpa. But is also amazing that it never stops, making life spicy, and fast-paced. The important thing is to manage time well, even If we haven't a bigger purpose.

### Maude (20)

Time is a perception that helps us find our bearings and interact with other people.  It's a bit of a mysterious concept that seems to change depending on our state of mind (it's relative).  Often it serves to remind us that nothing is forever and it can bring both fear and relief.
I feel a little disoriented about time, I know my time on earth is limited but I don't know yet how I'm going to use it.  I feel like I have time to do a lot of things but at the same time I feel like I won't be able to do everything.  It's confusing.
