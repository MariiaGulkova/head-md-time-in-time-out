## How people relate to time depending on age

- 2022-11-02

Based on the interviews conducted and the collected illustrative materials from people, depending on the age category, I concluded that people have different positions and associations to the question - what is time for them, how do they relate to time. For me, the most interesting conclusion was that each age category feels the passage of time differently. And this gave me the idea of a world where everyone can choose their own speed of time and development
