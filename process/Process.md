## Summary of the interview
All the people I asked had their own point of view about time, but if I try to generalize, for the older generation, time is a marker for determining events. Something that helps to determine the point of being. In the responses of the younger generation, time is a resource that will never be enough, time frightens them
## The results of a small theoretical investigation
Initially, a person perceives time from a psychological aspect. Einstein also reported this when he explained his theory of relativity using an everyday example: he said that an hour spent in good company would seem shorter than five minutes spent on a hot stove. But psychological time and the definition of time in physics are of course different, because from a psychological point of view it is not uniform and can go faster or slower.

- How did the philosophical attitude to time change in the historical process:

- In the picture of the world of primitive man, time seemed cyclical, while the sense of time among primitive tribes was practically absent.

- In ancient philosophy, one of the first thinkers who studied the problems of the concept of time was Plato. He defined time as a moving image of eternity, which "arose together with the sky." Developing the ideas of Plato, Aristotle defined time as a measure of movement in relation to the past and future. This formulation, enshrined in his work "Physics", became the starting point in the natural science perception of time.

- The theocentric concept of time is inherent in the Middle Ages, according to which it acquires signs of constancy and inalienability. During the medieval period, mechanical clocks were invented in Europe, which were intended primarily for the precise performance of religious rituals in monasteries.

- In the philosophy of modern times, this concept is undergoing significant changes, having developed into a substantive temporal concept. In this regard, a special place is occupied by the theory of Newton, who divided time into absolute and relative. The first is truly mathematical and flows evenly and without regard to something external, the second is ordinary time, comprehended by the senses and realized in the categories of hours, days, weeks, etc. Revolutionary for that era, the concept of time belongs to - - Kant, who put forward the theory that time is a subjective condition necessary for a person to contemplate the world and to know himself.

- The modern understanding of time is largely based on Einstein's theory of relativity, which completely changed the established paradigm, eliminating the absolutism of time. According to the concept of the scientist, time does not exist outside of being, and its properties are determined by the existence of the world.

- In modern philosophy, the problem of time remains relevant and the process of understanding this concept is still at the stage of development.
