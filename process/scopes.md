### Scope

## Silas - 4 
Hey, I’m Silas. I’m 4 years old. I have a lot of time, a whole hundred hours! I have time to play with the fire truck, and go to the station to see the arrival of the train, and check if all is well with the neighbor's cows. My time goes very slowly, and I have time to do everything I want!

## Katerina - 14
Hello, I’m Katerina….I’m 14 years old. Time doesn't matter to me. I live the way I want, no matter what time it is on the clock. I want to have breakfast at night - I do it. I want to sleep all day - I sleep. I am free in my choice, and time does not hinder me. Time is not a border for me

## Nastia (Anastasia) - 19
Hey, I’m Nastia. I’m 19 years old. Time for me is a resource, a currency. I spend a lot of time on my studies and work, and I never have enough time for everything. And time limits me - to be in time for school, to be in time for everything that I have planned, because you don’t know when life can be interrupted. Time goes by too fast

## Peregrin - 38
Hey, I’m Peregrin. I’m 38 years old. Everything in my life is relative. In the morning I was late for the train and time passed very quickly for me. But at lunchtime, when I really wanted to go to the toilet, and he was busy, time flowed very slowly for me. My time is relative, but at the same time measured

## Svetlana - 78
Hey, I’m Svetlana. I’m 78 years old. When I'm happy, time passes faster, when I'm sad, time passes very slowly. But I have more than enough time to get through the difficulties and be happy. Time is beautiful and it's not in a hurry
