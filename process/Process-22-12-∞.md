## Time travelers 

// Update Scope

Silas - 4

Hey, I’m Silas. I’m 4 years old. I have a lot of time, a whole hundred hours! I have time to play with the fire truck, and go to the station to see the arrival of the train, and check if all is well with the neighbor's cows. My time goes very slowly, and I have time to do everything I want!

Katerina - 14

Hello, I’m Katerina….I’m 14 years old. Time doesn't matter to me. I live the way I want, no matter what time it is on the clock. I want to have breakfast at night - I do it. I want to sleep all day - I sleep. I am free in my choice, and time does not hinder me. Time is not a border for me

Svetlana - 78

Hey, I’m Svetlana. I’m 78 years old. When I'm happy, time passes faster, when I'm sad, time passes very slowly. But I have more than enough time to get through the difficulties and be happy. Time is beautiful and it's not in a hurry //

The idea is to make a puppet theater inside the gadget, which will be accompanied at certain points in the plot by vibration, light, and may be sound

The main part of the body will be on the wrist, ((while the other can be squeezed in the hand(maybe))

Which materials would you like to use? - silicon or plastic
